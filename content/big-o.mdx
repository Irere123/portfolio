When learning about algorithms it's always some how complicated but found that if you take your time and read and solve some problems
you eventually find yourself at the top the game. Now I am talking about the real world problems that you might encounter during interview or job. So in this series I will take through the journey of exploring algorithms and a few data structures
in the most understandable way as much as possible, But let's not ignore that some parts might not be understandable at the first time learning them
but as you progress and solve more problems you will understand them much better.

## Big O Notation

Big O notation(with capital letter O) not a zero also called **_Landau's symbol_** is a symbolism used in complexity
theory, computer science and the maths to describe the asympotic behaviour of functions.

> Big O tells you how a function grows or declines with input

The letter O is used because the rate of growth of function is also called **_Order_**

> When analyzing and algorithm one might find that the time(or the number of steps) it takes to complete
> problem of size `n` is given by T(n)= 4n^2 - 2n + 2 if we ignore the constants(which is makes sense because those depend
> on the particular hardware the program is run on)
> we could say that "T(n) grows at order of n^2" and write: T(n) = n^2

So, if I am looking at piece of code or algorithm I ask myself like how efficient is it? Efficient covers alots of
resources

- CPU (time) usage -> Time complexity
- Memory usage -> Space complexity
- Disk usage
- Network usage

##### What's the difference between performance and complexity

- **Performance**: how much time/memory/disk is actually being used when a program is run.This depends on the computer,
  compiler, etc as well as the code

- **Complexity**: how do the resource requirements of the program as the program or algorithm scale,
  i.e What happens as the problem being solved gets large

Complexity affects performance but not the other way around.

The time required by function/procedure is prortional to the number of `basic operations` that it performs

- One arithmetic operation --> eg: \*, +
- One assignment operation --> eg: x := 0
- One test opetation --> eg: x = y, x != 9
- One read --> of primative type like integer of float
- One write --> of primative type like integer of float

### Overview

When measuring the time complexity or the space complexity of a piece of code or algorithm we the following metric and I have ordered them in order of how much
they grow as input grows from the best to worst

<Callout emoji={"✨"}>
  This order is not exactly how it might grow so don't be fooled by this order.
  For example the O(n^2) performs better than the O(n) when given small
  ``problem size`` or ``input size``
</Callout>

The following are the most common ones:

- O(1) --> Constant time(Best)
- O(log n) --> Logarithmic time(Good)
- O(n) --> Linear time(Fair)
- O(n^2) --> Quadratic time(Bad)

Not very common:

- O(2^n) --> Exponential time (Worst)
- O(n!) --> Factorial time(Worst)

### How to determine compelexities

In general, how can you determine the running time of a piece of code. So to determine the time
complexity it depends on the kinds of statements being used

#### Sequence of statements

```rust
// statement 1
// statement 2
// .....
// statement k
```

The total time is found by adding the times for all statements

> total time = time(statement 1) + time(statement 2) + .... + time(statement k)

#### If-Then-Else

```rust
 if i < 0 {
  // block 1(sequence of statements)
 } else {
  // block 2(sequence of statements)
 }
```

Either `block 1` will execute or `block 2` will execute- therefore, the worst case time is slower
of the two possibilities

> max(time(block 1), time(block 2))

if block 1 takes O(1) and block 2 takes O(N) then the if-then-else statement would would be O(N)

#### Loops

```rust
for i in 1..N {
 // sequence of statements
}

```

The loop executes **N** times, so the sequence of statements also executes **N** times and also have time complexity of **O(1)**,
the total time for the loop is **N \* O(1)** which would be **O(N)** overall.

#### Nested Loops

```rust

   for i in 1..N {
     for j in 1..M {
        // sequence of statements
     }
   }

```

The outer loop executes an **N** times. Every time the outer loop executes, the inner loop executes **M** times.
As a result, the statements in the inner loop execute a total of **N \* M** times. thus the Complexity is **O(N \* M)**

> In common special case where the stopping condition of the inner loop is **J < N** instead of **J < M**
> (i.e the innner loop executes **N** times) the total complexity for the two loops is **O(N^2)**

#### Statements and function/procedure calls

When a statement involves a function/procedure call, the complexity of the statement includes the complexity
of the function/procedure.

Assume that you know that function/procedure takes **_f_** constant time and that function/procedure **_g_**
takes time proportional to value of its parameter **_k_**. Then the statements have Complexity

- f(k) --> O(1)
- g(k) --> O(k)

when loop is involved, the same rule applies

```rust

 for i in 1..N {
  g(J);
 }
```
